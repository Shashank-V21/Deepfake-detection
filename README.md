# Deepfake Detection System

This project is a deep learning-based application designed to detect deepfake videos by combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction with an SVM classifier for classification. It features a simple GUI for uploading videos and returns whether the video is real or fake.

---

## Features
- Real-time deepfake detection with video upload
- Uses **MTCNN** for face detection and **Xception** for feature extraction
- Classifies frames using a trained **SVM model**
- Majority voting across frames to determine video authenticity
- GUI built with **Tkinter** for user interaction

---

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- MTCNN
- scikit-learn
- Tkinter (GUI)

---

## Dataset
- [FaceForensics++](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepfake-detection.git
cd deepfake-detection
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Train the model (optional)**
```bash
python deepfake_detection_proj.py  # Edit the script to call train_classifier() with real & fake video lists
```

4. **Run the app**
```bash
python deepfake_detection_proj.py
```
